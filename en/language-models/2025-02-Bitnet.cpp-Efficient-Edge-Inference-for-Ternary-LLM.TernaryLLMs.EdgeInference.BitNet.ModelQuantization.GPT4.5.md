## Abstract and Motivation

The growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emphasized the necessity of efficient deployment on edge devices, especially under constraints of computational capacity and privacy concerns. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an optimized inference system specifically targeting BitNet b1.58 and ternary large language models (LLMs). Given the importance of mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) for inference speed, Bitnet.cpp proposes a unique mpGEMM library that addresses inefficiencies and enables lossless inference on edge devices.

## Identification of Core Challenges

Current implementations, while effective in general-purpose usage, face significant limitations in handling ternary weights due to spatial inefficiencies and misalignments with training quantization schemes, thus impeding lossless inference. Specifically, previous methodologies employed "per-block quantization with a static block length," resulting in inconsistencies with BitNet b1.58's training schemes.

## Key Contributions

### Innovative mpGEMM Library

We propose Bitnet.cpp, featuring two novel kernels:

Ternary Lookup Table (TL): An element-wise lookup table-based solution addressing spatial inefficiencies and enhancing computation speed.

Int2 with Scale (I2_S): A multiply-and-add-based solution ensuring precise adherence to BitNet b1.58 training schemes, enabling true lossless inference.

"Our key idea is to avoid intricate bit-level manipulations by directly operating the weight elements when designing mpGEMM, while strictly aligning with BitNet b1.58 training schemes."

### Technical Innovations

Element-wise LUT-based (ELUT)

Our proposed ELUT strategy improves upon traditional bit-wise methods by directly enumerating possible ternary weight combinations, significantly reducing computational complexity:

"ELUT is computationally more efficient than the MAD-based solution... Therefore, ELUT is more suitable for deployment in practical scenarios."

Signed-Unsigned Weight Splitting

We introduce an approach to separate weights into signed and unsigned components, addressing the misalignment issues inherent in ternary weight computations and preserving memory efficiency.

Pack-and-Unpack Technique

To enable lossless precision, we implement a pack-and-unpack methodology, maintaining intermediate results in int16 format, thereby overcoming overflow challenges in SIMD instruction-based computations.

Empirical Evaluations

Our experiments demonstrate Bitnet.cpp's substantial practical advantages:

6.25x inference speedup compared to full-precision baselines.

Up to 2.32x faster inference than existing low-bit baselines.

This represents a significant advancement in practical inference performance:

"Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a 6.25x increase in speed over full-precision baselines and up to 2.32x over low-bit baselines, setting new benchmarks in the field."

Quality assessments validate that our approach achieves near-identical performance to Float16 baselines, thereby confirming the minimal to no loss in inference precision:

"Both TL1_0 and TL2_0 achieve nearly identical perplexity compared to Float16 on WikiText2 and maintain accuracy comparable to Float16 on WinoGrande and HellaSwag."

## Conclusion and Future Directions

Bitnet.cpp represents a significant advancement in efficient and lossless edge inference for ternary LLMs. Future work will expand our system's applicability beyond ternary LLMs and explore further optimization strategies for initial computation stages.
