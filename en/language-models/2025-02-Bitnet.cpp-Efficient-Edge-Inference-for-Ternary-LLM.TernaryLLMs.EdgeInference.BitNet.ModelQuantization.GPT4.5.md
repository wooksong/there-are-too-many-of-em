## Abstract and Motivation

The growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emphasized the necessity of efficient deployment on edge devices, especially under constraints of computational capacity and privacy concerns. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an optimized inference system specifically targeting BitNet b1.58 and ternary large language models (LLMs). Given the importance of mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) for inference speed, Bitnet.cpp proposes a unique mpGEMM library that addresses inefficiencies and enables lossless inference on edge devices.

## Introduction

The advent of quantized large language models (LLMs), specifically ternary-weight models like **BitNet b1.58**, addresses the computational limitations and privacy concerns associated with deploying large models on edge devices. These models quantize weights into three discrete values {-1, 0, 1}, significantly reducing memory and computational costs. Although theoretical interest in ternary models has risen, the gap remains between theory and practical inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

To bridge this gap, the authors developed **Bitnet.cpp**, a specialized inference system optimized for ternary-weight LLMs, particularly BitNet b1.58. It introduces a new mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) library that efficiently handles non-integer bit quantization of weights (1.58 bits per weight, precisely).

## Ternary LLM & mpGEMM on Edge

### Features of Ternary LLMs

Ternary models reduce weights to three possible values {-1, 0, 1}. Thus, the information per weight is approximately 1.58 bits:

\[
\text{Bits per weight (bpw)} = \frac{\log(3)}{\log(2)} \approx 1.58
\]

This quantization achieves significant compression, facilitating deployment on devices with limited bandwidth and computational resources.

**Lossless inference** is achievable by preserving training quantization constraints during inference, ensuring that inference and training computations match precisely.

### Taxonomy of Edge mpGEMM Methods

Edge mpGEMM methods are classified into two primary strategies:

- **Multiply-then-add (MAD-based)**: Directly performs dot products.
- **Lookup Table (LUT-based)**: Uses precomputed lookup tables for rapid calculation.

Further, these methods are distinguished into:

- **Bit-wise**: Operates at bit-level granularity, facing inefficiencies when dealing with ternary values.
- **Element-wise**: Operates at weight-element granularity, offering improved handling of ternary quantization.

## Methodology

Bitnet.cpp introduces two core kernel designs within its mpGEMM library:

### Fast Edge Inference: TL (Ternary Lookup Table)

TL uses an **element-wise LUT-based** approach, significantly reducing the computational complexity from \(O(MNK)\) (MAD-based) to approximately \(O(MNK/g)\), where \(g\) is the group size. This approach benefits from an efficient **element-wise mirror consolidation**:

> "Half of the values enumerated for LUT are inversely related to the other half, effectively halving the LUT size."

#### Element-wise LUT formulation:

The standard MAD-based GEMM operation is defined as:

\[
R = \sum_{i=1}^{K} A_i W_i
\]

The bit-wise LUT-based method is typically formulated as:

\[
R = \sum_{i=1}^{b}\sum_{j=1}^{K/g}\text{Lookup}(bLUT_j, W_{ij})
\]

In contrast, the novel **element-wise LUT-based (ELUT)** formulation is defined as:

\[
R = \sum_{i=1}^{K/g}\text{Lookup}(eLUT_i, W_i),\quad W \in \mathbb{Z}, |W|=C
\]

where \( C \) is the cardinality of weights (for ternary, \(C=3\)). This method directly enumerates possible values, significantly improving efficiency.

### Lossless Edge Inference: I2_S (Int2 with Scale)

To ensure exact matching with BitNet b1.58 training schemes, the authors introduce **I2_S**, a MAD-based kernel, achieving:

> "lossless inference by strictly aligning inference quantization to training-time schemes."

## Experimental Results

Experiments on edge devices (Intel i7-13700H, Apple M2 Ultra) demonstrate significant improvements in inference speed:

### Representative Experimental Result:

> "Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a **6.25x speedup** compared to Float16 baselines and up to **2.32x speedup** over low-bit baselines."

Below is a specific example from the experimental results:

| Kernel  | bpw  | Lossless | WikiText2 Perplexity ↓ | Winograd Accuracy ↑ | HellaSwag Accuracy ↑ |
|---------|------|----------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Float16 | 16   | ✓        | 11.29                  | 55.32               | 43.0                 |
| TL2_0   | 1.67 | ×        | 11.30                  | 55.32               | 43.0                 |
| I2_S    | 2    | ✓        | 11.29                  | 55.32               | 43.0                 |

## Theoretical Insights (Appendix A)

The ELUT method shows comprehensive advantages over traditional methods. Computational complexity is significantly lower compared to MAD-based methods when \(Cg < M\):

- MAD-based complexity: \(O(MNK)\)
- ELUT complexity: \(O(MNK/g)\)

Memory access complexity is theoretically higher for ELUT but mitigated through element-wise mirror consolidation, leading to overall efficiency improvements.

---

## Practical Analysis (Appendix B)

Multi-threaded performance tests clearly illustrate the computational advantage of the ELUT-based method over MAD-based (TQ1_0) and bit-wise (T-MAC):

> "In a multi-threaded environment, TL2_0 consistently outperformed TQ1_0 across all threads, further confirming ELUT's computational advantages."

---

## Potential and Limitations (Appendix C)

ELUT shows significant potential for future hardware optimization. Current limitations are primarily bandwidth-constrained. With improvements in edge device bandwidth, ELUT-based methods have significant room for further performance enhancement:

> "Bandwidth significantly influences ELUT performance. Increasing bandwidth further unlocks ELUT potential."

---

## Conclusion

The authors address practical limitations of deploying ternary LLMs to edge devices by designing **Bitnet.cpp**, significantly improving performance and enabling lossless inference. The innovation primarily lies in shifting from bit-wise to finer-grained element-wise approaches, aligning inference precisely with training quantization. This work provides critical guidance for future deployment and optimization of low-bit inference solutions.
